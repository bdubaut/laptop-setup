# Laptop setup
This script, heavily inspired by the one made by [Thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/),
helps me setup a new developpment machine (MacOSX).

It installs all the things I use when I need to code.

## Installation
```
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bdubaut/laptop-setup/master/setup
less setup
sh setup 2>&1 | tee ~/setup.log
```
